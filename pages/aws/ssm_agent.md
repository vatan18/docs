# How to Install the SSM Agent on Ubuntu EC2 Instances

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have access to the EC2 instance, preferably via SSH.
- Confirm whether your instance requires SSM Agent installation (some AWS AMIs come pre-installed with it).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Connect to Your EC2 Instance:
Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
```

### 2. Create a Temporary Directory:
On your EC2 instance, create a temporary directory to store the SSM Agent installation file:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/ssm
```

### 3. Change to the Temporary Directory:
Navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd /tmp/ssm
```

### 4. Download the SSM Agent:
Depending on your system architecture, download the appropriate SSM Agent package:

- For x86_64 Instances:

```bash
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/debian_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.deb
```

- For ARM64 Instances:

```bash
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/debian_arm64/amazon-ssm-agent.deb
```

### 5. Install the SSM Agent:
Run the following command to install the SSM Agent:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i amazon-ssm-agent.deb
```

### 6. Verify SSM Agent Status:
Check if the agent is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent
```

The agent should be active and running. If itâ€™s inactive, you can enable and start it manually using:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable amazon-ssm-agent
sudo systemctl start amazon-ssm-agent
```

That's it! The SSM Agent should now be successfully installed and running on your EC2 instance.
